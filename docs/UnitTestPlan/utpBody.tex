%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GUIDELINES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%	Make the plan concise. Avoid redundancy and superfluousness. 
% 	If you think you do not need a section that has been mentioned 
% 	in the template, go ahead and delete that section in your 
% 	test plan.
% 	
% 	Be specific. For example, when you specify an operating system 
% 	as a property of a test environment, mention the OS Edition/Version 
% 	as well, not just the OS Name.
%  	
%	Make use of lists and tables wherever possible. Avoid lengthy 
% 	paragraphs.
% 
%	Have the test plan reviewed a number of times prior to baselining 
% 	it or sending it for approval. The quality of your test plan speaks 
% 	volumes about the quality of the testing you or your team is going to 
% 	perform.
% 	
%	Update the plan as and when necessary. An out-dated and unused 
% 	document stinks and is worse than not having the document in the 
% 	first place.

\section{Test Items}
The object under test is the Reporting module in version 1.0 of the Research Support System.

\section{Features to be Tested}

The features to be tested are divided into functional and non-functional tests. The aspects that will be tested and evaluated in these tests are described in the following sections. 
Describe the overall approach for the level of testing. For each major feature or group of features,
specify the approach that will ensure that they are adequately tested. The approach may be described in
sufficient detail to permit identification of the major testing tasks and estimation of the time required to
do each one.

\subsection{Functional}
The approach taken for the functional requirements testing is a black box testing approach. This means that the functionality of the application is tested without considering the internal implementation. Hence, one is aware of what the specific module should be able to accomplish but not how the module accomplishes it. Hence, the result returned by a given function is tested. Test cases are established based on the Software Requirements Specifications and the pre and post conditions for the Reporting module. Both negative and positive tests will be conducted. There are two main services, firstly to generate a report based on the progress status of the publications and secondly to create a report with information regarding all accreditation units active within a specified time period. Tests will be created to test whether the Reporting module performs the right functions to provide these services accurately. \\
\\ The following table displays the two main services that this module consists of and will be tested as well as the ID's of their respective test cases.

\begin{tabular}{ l|L{3cm}|L{3cm}|l } 
	\hline
	\textbf{Feature ID} & \textbf{SRS Source} & \textbf{Summary} & \textbf{Test Case ID}\\
	\hline
	\hline
	getAccreditationPointsReport & SRS Document, Section 2.4 bullet 1, page 18 & This service ensures that a user can generate a report with information regarding all accreditation units active within a specified time period  &\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
		TC01\\
		TC02\\
		TC03\\		
	\end{tabular}\\
	\hline
	getProgressReport & SRS Document, Section 2.4 bullet 2, page 19 & This service ensures that a progress report can be generated containing relevant information and filtered information & TC04\\
	\hline
	\hline
\end{tabular}	

\subsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For the non-functional testing, the code will firstly be evaluated to see whether there is flexibility in terms of the reporting framework used i.e. that the application functionality is not tied to one specific technology. In addition, the persistence provider should also be easily modifiable. 
\item The maintainability of the code will be evaluated in terms it being easy to understand by future developers who would work on the system. In addition, developers should be able to add and modify the functions in the classes with ease. The technologies chosen for the project will also be evaluated to ensure that they will still be available for a reasonable amount of years following the deployment of the application.
\item The system should be reliable and provide a deployment without single points of failure. Reliability of this module will be evaluated 
\item The testability of the system will be examined by mainly detecting the use of mock objects and automated unit and integration tests. These tests will further be examined as to whether they test whether the service contract in the specification was adhered to.
\item The deployability of the module will be evaluated to see whether the application could be deployed on an application server.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Features not to be Tested}
Features that are excluded from this test plan include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Features in modules outside of the Reporting module.
	\item Performance
	\item Scalability
\end{itemize}

For this level of testing, modules were allocated to different teams and therefore this testing activity is restricted to one module. Since the focus is only on verification of requirements, several important non-functional requirements that did not feature in the SRS are also not going to be tested.

\section{Test Identification}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item  Objective - Identify and briefly describe the special focus or objective for the test case or a series of test cases.
%This is much more detailed than the Test Items in the Level Test Plan. It may include the risk or priority for this particular test case or series of test cases.
%	\item  Inputs - Specify each input required to execute each test case. Some inputs will be specified by value (with
%tolerances where appropriate), whereas others, such as constant tables or transaction files, will be
%specified by name. Identify all appropriate databases, files, terminal messages, memory resident areas,
%and values passed by the operating system.
%	\item  Outcome(s) - Specify all outputs and the expected behavior (e.g., response time) required of the test items. Provide
%the exact value (s) (with tolerances where appropriate) for each required output and expected behavior.
%This section is not required for self-validating tests.

\section{Item Pass/Fail Criteria}
  

\section{Test Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item List test deliverables, and links to them if available, including the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Test Plan (this document itself)
	\item Test Cases 
	\item Test Reports
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} 
\section{Test Environment} 

\begin{enumerate} 
	\item Web Server - no server used in the code provided
	\item Database - no database used in the code provided
	\item OS - Linux, Windows, IoS etc.
	\item Browser - All browsers
	\item Java Version - version 7
	\item Testing Framework - JUnit
	\item List any testing or related tools.
	\item JUnit - The unit testing framework that will be used to test functional requirements
\end{enumerate}

\section{Risks}
	The following potential risks are found in this module:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Aggregating data for those whose names are incoherent from publication to publication.
	\item Values  which are out of bounds.
	\item Database is in an unusable state.
	\item Too much data to process at once.
\end{enumerate}

	The following are contingencies which could be used to prevent the potential risks from arising:
\begin{enumerate}

	\item Do a smart lookup on names and research groups.
	\item Always do bounds checking.
	\item Check that the database is in a stable state before attempting to access it.
	\item Use a map-reduce if necessary.
         

\end{enumerate} 

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first assumption is that the Jasper Report generated by the module consists of tables with columns for the name of person/group, publication name, publication type, organization associated with publication type, lifecycle state.
	\item The second assumption is that the module abides by the service contracts and implements the services as specified in the service contracts. In addition, we assume the pre and post conditions for the module hold and hence these will be tested.
	\item The first dependency is that since Java EE was used for implementation, a Java testing framework will be used for the tests
\end{enumerate}
