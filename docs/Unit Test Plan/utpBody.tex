%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GUIDELINES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%	Make the plan concise. Avoid redundancy and superfluousness. 
% 	If you think you do not need a section that has been mentioned 
% 	in the template, go ahead and delete that section in your 
% 	test plan.
% 	
% 	Be specific. For example, when you specify an operating system 
% 	as a property of a test environment, mention the OS Edition/Version 
% 	as well, not just the OS Name.
%  	
%	Make use of lists and tables wherever possible. Avoid lengthy 
% 	paragraphs.
% 
%	Have the test plan reviewed a number of times prior to baselining 
% 	it or sending it for approval. The quality of your test plan speaks 
% 	volumes about the quality of the testing you or your team is going to 
% 	perform.
% 	
%	Update the plan as and when necessary. An out-dated and unused 
% 	document stinks and is worse than not having the document in the 
% 	first place.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to give an overview of the test plan for the reporting module. This document will outline the approaches used to test the module. Functional as well as non-functional requirements will be tested. This document will give an indication as to how well the reporting module of the system performs. It will also provide a list of functionalities to be tested and their respective results. This test plan will focus on the requirements outlined in the software requirements specification(SRS) instead of the requirements implamented in the reporting module. 
\subsection{Scope}
\begin{enumerate}
%Needs to be updated according to final structure
	\item Provide an overview of the test plan.
		
The remainder of this document is structured as follows. It will give references to related documents. This document will   list the features to be tested for both functional and non-functional requirements, it will also list features that will not be tested and reasons thereof. The approach to testing will be mentioned, the passing and failing of tests will be given and for all tests the respective suspension and resumption criteria will be stated. References to supporting work on this test plan will be supplied. The test environment will be outlined. Test efforts/costs will be estimated. The training of staff involved to use the system will be mentioned and the responsibilities of the different users will be mentioned. The risks involved in using this system as well as contingency plans will be given. Assumptions and dependencies of this test plan will be mentioned, and the approvers of this test plan will be listed.

	\item Specify the goals/objectives.

The goal of this test plan is to identify possible flaws in the implementation of the reporting module. If flaws are found they will be detailed in this report. The aim would then be for the implementers to either complete unmet requirements or to fix the implementation of identified incorrect code.

	\item Specify any constraints.

The constraints of developing a test plan for this module is the vague documentation of this module given in the SRS.
