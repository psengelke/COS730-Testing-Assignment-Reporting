\section{Introduction}
The functions within the Reporting module in the Research Support System were tested with unit tests to determine whether the pre and post conditions specified in the service contracts were met. The results of the tests are provided in this report. The non functional requirements of the system were also tested/ evaluated and these results are also described in this report.

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a report of the results of the unit tests that tested the pre and post conditions of the functions contained in the reporting module. In addition the results of the non-functional requirements tests are also provided in this report. Any variances of the test items from their specifications are reported on and reasons for these variances are supplied. The actual testing process has also been evaluated. 
\subsection{Scope}
%Specify the contents and organization of this document. Include references to any information captured in automated tools and not contained in this document.
This document provides the results of tests conducted to test the functional and non functional requirements of the Reporting module of the Research Support System. This document is organized as follows: firstly, a brief summary of the test results is provided in the section titled Overview of Test Results. In the section following the brief summary, a detailed description of the test results is provided where all resolved and unresolved anomalies is identified and described. Any variances of the test items from their specifications is reported on. The reasons for each variance is also stated here. The actual testing process is also evaluated in this section. In the section that follows that one, rationale for decisions made is stated. The final section of the document contains the recommendations and conclusions.

\section{References}
For each test item (in our case, the Reporting module), supply references to the following documents if they exist: Master Test
Plan, Level Test Plan (The unit test plan is all we have), Level Test Design, Level Test Cases, Level Test Procedures, Level Test Logs,
and Anomaly Reports.

Introduce the following subordinate sections. This section provides an overview of the test results, all
of the detailed test results, rationale for all decisions, and the final conclusions and recommendations.

\section{Overview of Test Results}
Summarize the evaluation of the test items. Identify the items tested, indicating their version/revision
level. Indicate the environment in which the testing activities took place, and its impact (if any).

\section{Detailed Test Results}
Summarize the results of testing. Identify all resolved anomalies and summarize their resolutions (or
reference where that information is available). Identify all unresolved anomalies. If anomalies are
deferred, explain (or reference) the process for handling deferrals.\par

Summarize the major testing activities and events. Summarize the relevant metrics collected.
Report any variances of the test items from their specifications. Indicate any variances from the test
documentation (e.g., test changes or tests not executed). Specify the reason for each variance (or
specified group(s) of variances), or reference where it is recorded.\par

Evaluate the comprehensiveness of the testing process (e.g., coverage metrics, if specified) against the
comprehensiveness criteria specified in the Level Test Plan, if the plan exists.

\section{Other Tests and evaluations}
- Deployable into application server?
The 
- Provide the maven build with appropriate dependancies
- Use of Jasper Reports?
- Use of contracts and mock objects

\section{Rationale for Decisions}
Specify the issues that were considered for any decisions and the reason(s) for the selection of the
conclusion(s).

\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}
Specify an overall evaluation of each test item, including its limitations. This evaluation will be based
on the test results and on the item level pass/fail criteria. An estimate of failure risk may be included.
Recommend its status relative to availability for production use, and under what circumstances (e.g.,
immediately, with a specified subset of anomalies resolved, or never). This may include identification
of anomaly clusters in functionality and/or anomaly root cause analysis.
